=============

The team of modscraft.eu says Hello and welcome to our GitHub repository.
We are currently developing and composing a nice, hard modpack for Minecraft and want to apply with it to the Feed the Beast team. But first we want our unique idea of a mod to be completely compatible with 1.7.2, debug and test it and gather the final permissions of other mod's authors.
THere is not much to see at the moment, thats because some testing stuff is not pushed immediately. SLowly this repository will fill up though and you can use our work in your server too, if you want. Conditions for that will by then be released too.
If you have a bugfix or suggestion, feel free to fill a Pull request! :)
